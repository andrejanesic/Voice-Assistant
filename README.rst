Voice Assistant
===============

Miniature voice assistant developed in Python with Tensorflow/Keras. Group assignment conducted as part of the Voice Recognition (5025) and Deep Learning (8032) subjects.

Project Specs
-------------

This project involves the creation of a miniature *voice assistant* app. The system supports the following functionalities:

-  Recognizing speech in voice audio
-  Voice-2-Text (recognition of different pre-defined commands, and their parameters)
-  Processing of commands through internal components and external APIs to generate a response
-  Sentiment analysis of spoken text (if such a command is issued)
-  Text-2-Voice (responding to user's command)

The project relies on deep learning methods (transformers and NLP models) for text-to-speech, sentiment analysis, speech-to-text, etc.
