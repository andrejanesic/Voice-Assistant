# Voice Assistant

Miniature voice assistant developed in Python with Tensorflow/Keras. Group assignment conducted as part of the Voice Recognition (5025) and Deep Learning (8032) subjects.

## Project Specs

This project involves the creation of a miniature _voice assistant_ app. The system supports the following functionalities:

* Recognizing speech in voice audio
* Voice-2-Text (recognition of different pre-defined commands, and their parameters)
* Processing of commands through internal components and external APIs to generate a response
* Sentiment analysis of spoken text (if such a command is issued)
* Text-2-Voice (responding to user's command)

The project relies on deep learning methods (transformers and NLP models) for text-to-speech, sentiment analysis, text-to-speech, etc.
